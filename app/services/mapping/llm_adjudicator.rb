module Mapping
  # Stage 2 of retrieve -> rerank. The heuristic pass (ComputeMappingProposalsJob)
  # retrieves a candidate set per source field as open MappingProposals; this
  # reranks/adjudicates that set with an LLM reading the full role dossiers, then
  # writes an `llm` signal + rationale onto the chosen proposal and rescores so
  # the LLM's pick rises to the top.
  #
  # Cost: one LLM call per source field that has open proposals. Callers should
  # scope which fields run (see ComputeLlmAdjudicationJob / rake mapping:adjudicate)
  # since Opus over thousands of fields is expensive.
  #
  # Hallucination guard: candidate ids are an enum in the tool schema AND
  # validated against the supplied set; an unrecognized id is treated as NO_MATCH.
  # Position-bias guard: candidate order is shuffled per call (research: LLM
  # rerankers anchor on slot 1).

      <<~SYS
        You map a Salesforce (Sailfin) accounts-receivable field onto the single
        best-fit field in a forward-looking "cashline" data model, choosing from a
        fixed candidate list.

        Decide on FUNCTIONAL ROLE, not name similarity. Weigh the field's
        relationships, data distribution, formula, picklist vocabulary, and the role
        of its parent object. A close name with the wrong role is a worse match than
        a different name with the right role. If none of the candidates is a genuine
        fit, return NO_MATCH rather than forcing one.

        Also produce:
        - role_note: one or two plain sentences on what the source field stores and
          its role in the object — the kind of note a data analyst would jot down.
        - disposition: keep / need_in_cashline / discard.
          * keep — a candidate genuinely fits (you chose one); it exists in both systems.
          * need_in_cashline — no candidate fits, BUT the field is actually USED in
            Sailfin (judge from its data stats: low null rate, real distinct values,
            meaningful content). Cashline lacks this and should add it.
          * discard — no candidate fits AND the field is unused or vestigial (mostly
            null, single/zero distinct values, or pure Salesforce administrative
            plumbing). Not worth carrying into cashline.

module Salesforce
  # BFS walker over Salesforce describe payloads. Starts at `seed_objects` and
  # crosses reference fields outward until either max_hops is exceeded or the
  # next hop falls outside the configured allowlists.
  #
  # An edge is followed only if both endpoints satisfy
  #
  #     (object.namespacePrefix ∈ namespace_allowlist)
  #     OR  (object.api_name      ∈ standard_allowlist)
  #
  # The gateway object that exposes an out-of-scope lookup is itself visited;
  # the off-scope target is not. Self-references and diamond merges do not
  # cause extra describes — each object is described at most once.
